Code Organization
=====================

phase1/ holds our working code from Phase I of the project.

phase2/ holds the code for Phase II. 
LL1Parser.java is where we store methods to calculate first/follow sets and the parsing table
TableWalker.java is currently not functional, but it is what walks over the input tokens and validates them.
HomeStarRunner2.java is the entry point of our program. It calls FinalDriver.java.
FinalDriver.java is what actually controls the program and calls all of the necessary parts.

phase2/tests holds the various testing documents that we used
    to test things like first/follow sets and the parsing table
phase2/outputs holds the outputs of the aforementioned testing

Compiling
======================

It's easiest to compile our project through eclipse due to the number of packages that we have.

Testing our code requires altering the source code in HomeStarRunner2.java where it calls FinalDriver.
